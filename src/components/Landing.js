                Hi! I'm Louie. I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for learning about cutting edge technology.
                When I'm not building nimble, scalable web apps with React & Redux, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and AWS, you can
                find me at the park with my dogs or eating a home-cooked meal with my family! I currently live and work in
                Colorado Springs, CO, but I am open to opportunities in any major city in the US.
