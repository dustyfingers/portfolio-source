Hello!

My name is Louie, and I am a full stack software engineer based in sunny Colorado Springs, Colorado. This is my personal portfolio site I built with React, Bootstrap 5 and SASS. I really like what I came up with, and I hope you enjoy perusing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

ps. run this project using yarn!
